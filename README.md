# US-Severity-Crash-2016-2023
This project uses machine learning to predict the severity of road accidents in the United States using data from 2016 to 2023. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help reduce the impact of severe accidents and support data-driven traffic safety measures.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Data Source**: US Accident Dataset (2016–2023)
- **Objective**: Predict accident severity and identify key contributing factors
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, SHAP
- **Outputs**:
  - Trained predictive model
  - SHAP visualizations for feature importance
  - Insights dashboard
  - PowerPoint summary presentation

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Accident severity is strongly influenced by:
  - Weather and visibility
  - Time of day
  - Speed limits and road types (urban/rural)
- Rural and nighttime accidents tend to have higher severity


## 📌 Next Steps

- Incorporate real-time weather and traffic data
- Explore deep learning models
- Deploy as an API or dashboard for real-world use
